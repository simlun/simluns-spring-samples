h1. simlun's Spring MVC

A Spring 3.1 MVC project, configured using "FreeMarker":http://www.freemarker.org/ for @HTML@ views and "Jackson":http://jackson.codehaus.org/ for @JSON@ views.

h2. Features

* Automatically switches between @HTML@ and @JSON@ output depending on file extension in request.
* Shows how i18n can be configured with Spring and "FreeMarker":http://www.freemarker.org/.
* Shows how logging can be configured using "SLF4J":http://www.slf4j.org/ and "Logback":http://logback.qos.ch/.
* Almost 100 % free from @XML@ configuration. Instead, this project focuses on using the new Spring @Configuration@ annotation. Three @XML@ configuration files do exist in the project:
** @logback.xml@ to configure the logging framework
** @pom.xml@, the Maven Project Object Model
** and of course the @web.xml@ to configure the Java Web Application.

h2. TODO

* Wipe the whole project and rebuild it using TDD. Since this is mostly configuration, it will be more like Integration Test Driven Development ;)
